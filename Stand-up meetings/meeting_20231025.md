##### 1. Meeting Topics

How the code for the VSCode extension fits together

##### 2. Review

1. Lyu Guanchen missed the stand-up meeting due to acute enteritis, and suffered a lot last week, so the code completion date has been postponed to 11-01
2. Wang Yuchen purchased a Huawei cloud server in Hong Kong on October 22, but due to unknown reasons, the access IP was disabled by the cloud server. He could only get a refund and plan to buy a Tencent cloud server in mainland China and redeploy it recently.
3. Since the cookie storage problem is difficult to solve, Ding Yi modified the verification of the back-end interface and asked front-end developers to complete the page function development first.
4. Defective Right-Click Commit Revision Status
5. Wang Jiahe solved problems about multiple toolbar display
