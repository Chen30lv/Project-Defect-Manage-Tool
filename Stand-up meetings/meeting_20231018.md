**Participants**：Wang Yuchen, Lyu Guanchen, Wang Jiahe, Ding Yi, Li Jiayi, Ha Yanguang  
**Moderator**：Wang Yuchen

##### 1. Meeting Topics

Exchanged front-end and back-end development as well as interface interfacing issues

##### 2. Meeting Content

As three members were unfamiliar with the front-end and back-end separation development model, Ding Yi introduced the way of interface call and how the front-end relies on the back-end interface to achieve the function.  
Through discussion, Ding Yi will write an interface document recently and provide it to the front-end code development members to improve the development efficiency.

##### 3. Review

1. The main interfaces of Spring Boot have been completed.
2. Spring Boot should take into account the deployment of the server, to facilitate the implementation of front-end functionality and tuning.
3. The development of the VSCode extension code has encountered some problems；
- Due to the fact that both members were new to VSCode development, the code in each section worked fine on its own, but could not be integrated with the system.
- 侧边栏异步问题
- cookie校验问题
