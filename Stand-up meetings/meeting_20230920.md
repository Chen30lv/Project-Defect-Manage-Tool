### Stand-up meeting in 2023-09-20

**Participants**：Wang Yuchen, Lyu Guanchen, Wang Jiahe, Ding Yi, Li Jiayi, Ha Yanguang  
**Moderator**：Wang Yuchen

##### 1. Meeting Topics

The first meeting of the project, where we need to define the theme of the project and discuss specific requirements

##### 2. Meeting Content

After discussion, we determined that we wanted to implement a tool that would help programmers correlate writing code to modify defects with completing defect submissions during defect modification sessions.
Specifically we wanted to develop a VSCode extension to help programmers integrate more effectively into the software development system.  
  
The innovation of this topic is that we can integrate VSCode into the original company's software development ecosystem, and in the modification of defects to avoid programmers to frequently cut the screen to submit defects, to improve the focus and efficiency of the work.

Finally, we decided to have a weekly stand-up meeting on Wednesdays to review the content of the past development cycle and define the development work for the next development cycle  

##### 3. Review

First meeting of the project, so no review.
