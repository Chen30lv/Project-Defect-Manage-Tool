### Stand-up meeting in 2023-09-27

**Participants**：Wang Yuchen, Lyu Guanchen, Wang Jiahe, Ding Yi, Li Jiayi, Ha Yanguang  
**Moderator**：Wang Yuchen

##### 1. Meeting Topics

Discuss the architecture of the defect management system, and the goals of the three sprint developments;
A review of last week's development progress

##### 2. Meeting Content

1. We decided to use a front-end and back-end separated architecture - VSCode Extension + Spring Boot to implement the whole system, and use Kafka to achieve asynchronous communication with the original development ecology.  
2. Since five members have midterm exams for one course after the holidays, the next cycle is still focused on documentation and study preparation.
3. Discussed the implementation method of the server---cloud server or docker deployment, and finally decided to implement the function based on the cloud server first. If sprint3 has enough time, docker deployment will be carried out. 
4. We have modified the sprint cycle specified in the course:
- Sprint1 (Weeks 3 - 5) 
- Sprint2 (Weeks 6 - 9) 
- Sprint3 (Weeks 9 - 11)
