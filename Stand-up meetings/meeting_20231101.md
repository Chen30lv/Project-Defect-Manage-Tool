### Stand-up meeting in 2023-11-01

**Participants**：Wang Yuchen, Lyu Guanchen, Ding Yi, Li Jiayi, Ha Yanguang  
**Moderator**：Wang Yuchen

##### 1. Meeting Topics

Discuss the division of labor in writing project reports

##### 2. Review
 
1. It is really unfortunate that Wang Jiahe is at home with a fever of 40 degrees Celsius due to COVID-19, and may miss development work for a week. The functions of various parts of VSCode will continue to be promoted by Lyu Guanchen and Li Jiayi.
2. Ha Yanguang found that displaying statistical charts in the sidebar was not technically realistic, so we discussed the implementation plan for the new defect statistics function: the final decision was to give priority to displaying statistical information in a list, and if there was enough time later, display statistical charts in webview.
3. The Spring Boot service has been deployed to the server, and the ip is 134.175.54.235, the port is 8101, The interface documentation can be found at http://134.175.54.235:8101/api/doc.html

##### 3. Process
Wang Yuchen, Li Jiayi and Ha Yanguang start to prepare the final report in this week
